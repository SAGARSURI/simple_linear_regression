# Simple Linear Regression

# Introduction
This is simple linear regression program as per the challenge created by siraj. I have created a script that first convert the txt file to csv file and then split the data into training data and testing data. Since its a supervised learning thats why i split the data into training and testing data. Later I represented it into graph and printed the mean squared error.
